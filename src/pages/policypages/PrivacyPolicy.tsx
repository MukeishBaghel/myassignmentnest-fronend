                        Unregulated data collection or collecting data by violating the applicable laws can bring an individual a hefty penalty of up to CAD 100,000 under PIPEDA and CAD 10,000 under CASL.

                        We store your data as long as necessary for purposes we have discussed in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is permitted by law, like tax, accounting, and applicable legalities. When we no longer have legitimate requirements for your data, we either anonymise or delete information. In case of backup archives, we will securely store your data and isolate it from further processing until it is deleted completely.

                        We have taken all the necessary measures and implemented the latest technological and organisational security norms and measures to ensure top-notch data security while processing. However, despite all our sincere effort to protect your personal information, no storage technology can guarantee complete security, so we won’t make unrealistic promises stating no hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised parties can break into our security system to collect, steal, access, modify your data. We do our best to protect your information from unsafe sources. Still, transmitting your data to and from our services should be at your own risk. You should only access our services and products within a safe environment.

                        We do not knowingly collect information or market our products and services to children under 18. When you use our services or products, we assume that you are 18 years of age or a guardian of a minor and consent to use our services. If we learn that a user is less than 18, the account is immediately deactivated, and we take the necessary measures to delete their personal data from our systems. If you know someone below 18 availing of our services or products, please notify us at support@myassignmentnest.com. We will take instant action.

                    <p>
                        Countless web browsers and many mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-not-track (DNT) feature in the system so the user can activate the signal according to their preference and not worry about being monitored or data processing. However, no standard technology has been finalised for recognising and implementing DNT signals on a larger scale. Due to this, we do not respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your preference. Despite so, if we adopt a standard for online tracking in the future, we will inform you about the practice and include it in our revised version of our privacy policy.
